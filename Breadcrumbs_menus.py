# As breadcrumb men√πs are quite popular today, I won't digress much on explaining them,
# leaving the wiki link to do all the dirty work in my place.
#
# What might not be so trivial is instead to get a decent breadcrumb from your current url.
# For this kata, your purpose is to create a function that takes a url, strips the
# first part (labelling it always HOME) and then builds it making each element but
# the last a <a> element linking to the relevant path; last has to be a <span> element getting the active class.
#
# All elements need to be turned to uppercase and separated by a separator,
# given as the second parameter of the function; the last element can terminate
# in some common extension like .html, .htm, .php or .asp; if the name of the last element
# is index.something, you treat it as if it wasn't there, sending users automatically to the upper level folder.
#
# A few examples can be more helpful than thousands of words of explanation, so here you have them:
#
# generate_bc("mysite.com/pictures/holidays.html", " : ") == '<a href="/">HOME</a> : <a href="/pictures/">PICTURES</a> : <span class="active">HOLIDAYS</span>'
# generate_bc("www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi", " / ") == '<a href="/">HOME</a> / <a href="/users/">USERS</a> / <span class="active">GIACOMOSORBI</span>'
# generate_bc("www.microsoft.com/docs/index.htm", " * ") == '<a href="/">HOME</a> * <span class="active">DOCS</span>'
# Seems easy enough?
#
# Well, probably not so much, but we have one last extra rule: if one element (other than the root/home)
# is longer than 30 characters, you have to shorten it, acronymizing it (i.e.: taking just the initials
# of every word); url will be always given in the format this-is-an-element-of-the-url and you should
# ignore words in this array while acronymizing:
# ["the","of","in","from","by","with","and", "or", "for", "to", "at", "a"];
# a url composed of more words separated by - and equal or less than 30 characters long needs
# to be just uppercased with hyphens replaced by spaces.
#
# Ignore anchors (www.url.com#lameAnchorExample) and parameters
# (www.url.com?codewars=rocks&pippi=rocksToo) when present.
#
# Examples:
#
# generate_bc("mysite.com/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/example.htm", " > ") == '<a href="/">HOME</a> > <a href="/very-long-url-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example/">VLUMSYME</a> > <span class="active">EXAMPLE</span>'
# generate_bc("www.very-long-site_name-to-make-a-silly-yet-meaningful-example.com/users/giacomo-sorbi", " + ") == '<a href="/">HOME</a> + <a href="/users/">USERS</a> + <span class="active">GIACOMO SORBI</span>'
# You will always be provided valid url to webpages in common formats, so you probably shouldn't
# bother validating them.
#
# If you like to test yourself with actual work/interview related kata, please also consider
# this one about building a string filter for Angular.js.
#
# Special thanks to the colleague that, seeing my code and commenting that I worked on that
# as if it was I was on CodeWars, made me realize that it could be indeed a good idea for a kata :)
